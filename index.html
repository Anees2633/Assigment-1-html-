           <h2>What is Computer</h2>
           <p>A <b>computer</b> is an electronic device that is capable of receiving, storing, processing, and outputting data. It operates under the control of instructions stored in its memory. Computers can perform a variety of tasks, ranging from simple calculations to complex operations such as running software applications, browsing the internet, playing games, and much more.

            Modern computers typically consist of hardware components such as a central processing unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices (hard drives or solid-state drives), input devices (keyboard, mouse, etc.), output devices (monitor, printer, etc.), and various peripheral devices (such as network adapters or graphics cards).</p>

            Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky.

When the blazing sun is gone, When he nothing shines upon, Then you show your little light, Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.

Then the travâ€™ller in the dark, Thanks you for your tiny spark, He could not see which way to go, If you did not twinkle so.
